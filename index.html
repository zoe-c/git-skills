#<h1>Zoe</h1>
##<p>Zoe has moved all of her life. Switching to first person: I am from everywhere and nowhere and now, Durham. Before coding, I was sitting on a BA degree, only using it for self projects and gifts and getting upset for not applying my knowledge and skillsets in my 'profession.'I wasn't challenging myself. Among many other reasons, I am here to do just that. I'm here for the challenge and resetting my 'life path'..</p>.
