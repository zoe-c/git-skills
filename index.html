<h1>Zoe</h1>
<p>Zoe has moved all of her life. Switching to first person: I am from everywhere and nowhere and now, Durham. Before coding, I was sitting on a BA degree, only using it for self projects and gifts and getting upset for not applying my knowledge and skillsets in my 'profession.'I wasn't challenging myself. Among many other reasons, I am here to do just that. I'm here for the challenge and resetting my 'life path'..</p>.
<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I'd like to learn JS, better understand CSS, and solidify HTML. In the grand scheme, I'm still new to all of this. I'd like to learn Ruby, maybe not so much Python, and see what/where (front/back) I work best with.</p>
